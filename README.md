# EasyMapReset
A map reset plugin for spigot based minecraft servers

# Commands

I only added one command which is "/easymapreset save" or "/emr save" for short.
It backups the world as it is at the second you execute the command. This way if you want to change the map, you don't have to remove the plugin and edit the map or anything like that.
